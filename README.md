# AccesoUsuarios
My first project using WinForms and C#

Running the project will open a Window where you can insert your credentials and access after being compared to the database credentials. There is a button wich the admin has to use to register new users into the database. [!NOTE The administrator has to insert his own credentials to access the new user register form.]
